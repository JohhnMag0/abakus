# Installation

Very important to say that for this program to work you will need the GNU Readline library.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohhnMag0/genp.git
# if clang
clang++ abakus.cpp -lreadline
# if g++
g++ abakus.cpp -lreadline
```

# Documentation

If you want to get an overview of how this works, you can get an idea in here: <https://johhnmag0.github.io/>.
Yes I got a good part of the idea of the structure of the code by reading about LLVM in the following link <https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html>
